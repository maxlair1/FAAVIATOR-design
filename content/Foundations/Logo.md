# Icon

## General Use
- When the icon is alone in a box, it cannot be any closer to any edge than is equal to the height of one “half-wing”. This is to ensure enough breathable space for the icon.  
- It is important to make sure that the flat planes are rotated at a 6deg angle.

## Variants
When enough contrast is available, always use the colored (brand colors) pair of wings. However, when accessibility and minimal interruption is intended, either of the two neutral variants can be used as well. Just make sure to use the proper one for each background color.

## App Icon
The main app icon is the colored set of wings. The wings should always touch the side of the icon on both the right and left edges. In future versions, the user can choose between the two app icons (and maybe more)

## Negative/Boxed
- Typically for use on dark backgrounds, you can also use the boxed negative version of the logo. In this version the wings are in the negative, while touching either edge.  
- One reason you might use this icon is **over imagery** or if you want a **colored background** to come through the wings.  
- Overall this is secondary and should be used sparingly.
